# [Bob's Mods] Chicken Job - (Improved Script)

## Disclosure

I did not write the original script. It was very outdated, I have done a complete review and updated all necessary components. As well as many optimisations and fixes I have also added a highly configurable config and qb-target'ing.

## Description

A chicken job for civilians in your city.

## Dependencies

- QB-Core

## Features

- Chicken capturing mini-game. Get in a pen with chickens and try to catch them by diving at them.
- Chicken processing simulation. Take the chickens you have captured to be processed and packaged.
- Optional to us qb-Target, can be toggled in config.
- Configurable reward pool for the chicken chase.

## Usage

- Start the job by going to the chicken farm.
- Catch chickens then take them to the chicken processing factory to be processed.

## Commands

- None

## Install

This script will automatically add the required items to the shared items. But you will need to add the images for those items. There are some example images attached.
